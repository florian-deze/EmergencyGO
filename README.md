# EmergencyGO
This IOS App is used to speed up the process of emergency call.

# Why ?
Emergencies facilities have less than 40 seconds to answer your call and less than 70 seconds to know your location, the situation state and your medical records if needed (like allergies to some medications). This amount of time is too short and when the call is done, the user in an emergency situation don't have any information about the current situation in the emergency facilities, does an ambulance is called ? is comming ? when ? etc...

# What is this App offer ?
The emergency call is only done by pressing one button on the App. The App will send an alert to the emergency facilities, with your precise location and eventually the type of the emergency.
Your medical records are put inside a database when you register.
On the other side, an employee in the emergency facility have a software or a web interface that receive the alrm to treat the emergency and can send information about the state of treatment of the emergency to the App user.

# How to install
git clone https://github.com/florian-deze/EmergencyGO.git
\cd EmergencyGO
\pod install

# What is the database used
Firebase
This is a personnal project used adapted for course at Luxembourg University.
Since it is a free account, the number of transaction is limited for sending and getting data from it.
Thus all rights on the database are restricted. Non others users except the owner (Florian DEZE) can fully use this App.

# Where is the software/web interface for the hospital employee
The interface was created by another person for the university project. It is not in my github account for now.
